    <!--JavaScript Data Types
    
        JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
            String
            Number
            Bigint
            Boolean
            Undefined
            Null
            Symbol
            Object

        The Object Datatype
        The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects:

        Built-in object types can be:

        objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.

        Examples
        // Numbers:
        let length = 16;
        let weight = 7.5;

        // Strings:
        let color = "Yellow";
        let lastName = "Johnson";

        // Booleans
        let x = true;
        let y = false;

        // Object:
        const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

        // Array object:
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

        // Date object:
        const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
        Note
        A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.
    -->

    <!--The Concept of Data Types
        In programming, data types is an important concept.

        To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

        Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

        let x = 16 + "Volvo";
        Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

        JavaScript will treat the example above as:

        let x = "16" + "Volvo";
        Note
        When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
    -->
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    let x = 16 + "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>When adding a string and a number, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    let x = "Volvo" + 16;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
    
    <hr>


    <!--JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:-->
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</p>

    <script>
    let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>


    <!--In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".

        In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.
    -->

    <!--JavaScript Types are Dynamic
        JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

    <!--JavaScript Strings
        A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

        Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

        Most programming languages have many number types:

        Whole numbers (integers):
        byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

        Real numbers (floating-point):
        float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

        Javascript numbers are always one type:
        double (64-bit floating point).

    <!--JavaScript BigInt
        All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.

        JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
